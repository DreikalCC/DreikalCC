## Hi there this is Aldo Villegas GuzmÃ¡n ðŸ‘‹

### I'm currently studying at Practicum - Web Developer program, learning about the back-end coding for servers with Express, Node, also learning how to properly structure REST APIs.

### I am working as a Jr. Front-End Developer at Cherie Young Desings, updating, modifying and reformating Real Estate Website on platforms such as Chime, Sierra, Boomtown and Kvcore.

# I'm looking to expand into a Full Stack Developer, I would like to develope web apps.

I also enjoy making bread and craft beer, it has taken a few years to get the hang of making both, and every batch makes you learn a bit more of how to mold your recipes into something better than the previous.


## The languages I handle are : HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, NODE and EXPRESS.
